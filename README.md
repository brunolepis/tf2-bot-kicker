## FAQ

**How can I set an icon for my server?**

- The file's name needs to be `server-icon.png` and its height and width must be `64x64` pixels. You also have to make sure that this image is inside of your Minecraft Server's folder.

**How can I install a plugin manually?**

- Go to <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/">this page</a> and choose which plugin you want to add to your server. Download it and make sure you save the jar file in your Minecraft Server's `plugins` folder. If your server is running, restart it.
